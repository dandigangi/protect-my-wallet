# Protect My Wallet

Cloud providers typically give developers access to free or low-cost resources to incentivize usage. I've accidentally created unnecessary bills multiple times during development. These scripts are my attempt at localized cloud CLI (AWS only) and Terraform wrappers to prevent accidental bills. The primary goal of this project is to practice various skills and experiment.
